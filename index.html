					<p>Three things you should know about me:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I have a passion for learning, growth and self-development that feeds my increasing interest in software development
							and web design.</li>
						<li>People can be motivated by a number of different things: money, time, fear, hunger, love, family, etc. I am, however,motivated
							by a desire to produce worth-while, high quality content while collaborating with like-minded individuals working
							toward a common goal.</li>
						<li>As Mel Brooks would say, the 2020 quarantine has only turned me <em>mostly</em> insane; but not entirely....yet.</li>

          <h2>Career.</h2>
					<p>After completing my collegiate career with my audio production company audioshire. being the main monetary driver, I found myself searching for something more; another avenue of creation, development and growth. Shortly there after, I sunk myself into a successful Technical Recruiting position as a way to expose myself to a myriad of potential career paths. Fairly early on, I discovered that my core values aligned with software development e.g. constant growth, learning and building things; it became a natural interest and a skill that I have begun to fiercely nurture.</p>

					<p>The same work ethic, collaboration and discipline that made funding my education through a passion project a reality will guide me toward a successful software & web development career.</p>
